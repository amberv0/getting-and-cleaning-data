#Explanation of the output files
There are two files generated by the script: tidy.txt and dirty.txt.
Variable names:
* subject - number identifying one of 30 subject
* activity - string identifying one of 6 activities
* all other 86 variables are described in data/features_info.txt file. From the variables in that file only the variables having "mean" or "std" in their name are preserved. The goal is to keep all the data we might need without possible elimination of some useful one (which could be the case if we filtered data by "mean()" and "std()".
The way data is processed is straightforward and described in README. The difference between the two output files tidy.txt and dirty.txt is also described there.
